1) see logs

2) The streams apply back preassure automatically, and wait till a new message can be consumed by the next stage

3)  Streams are a dataflow pipeline and the flow is data driven and not message driven.
    An actor reacts to messages, while a stream defines how data flows
    Actors run parallel to each other, while in streams the pipeline stages may be concurrent but not per default
